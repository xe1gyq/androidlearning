 Application Life Cycle
 Android Stack
  - App / Framework / Native / Kernel
  - Languages Java/C/C++/XML
 Application Component
  - Activity
  - Service
  - Content Provider
  - Broadcaster Receiver

Android Device Access
 $ adb shell

SysFs
 $ ls /sys/class/backlight/
 $ cat brightness
 $ ls /sys/class/timed_output/vibrator/
ToDo! Get into details of Sysfs implementation
ToDo! Look at sysfsutils package

DevFs
 $ echo hola > /dev/null
 $ ls /dev/ | grep gps
 $ file /dev/ttyTHS1

Audio
 $ ls /lib/linux-sound-base/
ToDo! Include /lib/linux* directory to Audio Workshop

Linux Kernel
Forked from mainline
Busybox ToolBox
User Space Vs Kernel Space
 $ ls /system/bin/tmp

ToDo! Practice with Tmpfs / Ramdisk / Ram Disk
 $ ls /data/system/users/ #
 $ id
 $ ps -aux | grep eclipse

Each Android Application is a new user
Data Vs System Partitions
When you flash your device in the factory there are 2 images:
 - system.img
 - userdata.im
 $ ls /system/
 $ ls /system/lib

System is a read-only partition
Applications are put into /data
System expands content under /data partition
 $ cd /data/data/com.google.android.gm/databases
 $ ls -l | grep gm
 $ ps | grep gm
 $ # Look at users, change and see behaviour
 $ su 70

? Who takes care of creating a user?
InstallDaemon by Zygote

 $ ps |  grep installd
 $ ls /dev | grep gps
 $ ps | grep system

2 ways to access hardware

 1. Using somebody else, another service

 Location Service / GPS / Binder
 $ top -t | grep system_server

 Mean to communicate between Application to Services? Binder
 Vibrator
 $ ls ~/aosp/frameworks/base/services/core/java/com/android/server/VibratorService.java
 $ ls /sys/class/timed_output/vibrator
 $ cat /home/student/aosp/frameworks/base/services/core/jni/com_android_server_VibratorService.cpp
 $ nano android/server/LocationManagerService.java

 Talk about permissions
 How do we ask access for permissions? Android Manifest
 HelloWorld application lookin to get Location Services
 Added under Android Manifest as ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
 $ ls /data/system/packages.xml
 $ adb pull /data/system/packages.xml

 Looked at the line where HelloWorld application
 Package Manager Service and Location Services are both under System Service
 $ adb push ...
 $ adb logcat
 $ ls ~/aosp/framework/base/location/java/android/location/ILocationListener.aidl

 2. Through belonging to a group Id
 $ ls /dev/socket
 Inet group

 There are 2 Securities Checks
 - Kernel Level Security Check
 - Location Service in Java through XML file

Kernel Drivers

 $ ls ~/kernel/goldfish/drivers/staging/android

 Binder
  $ ls /dev/binder
 Ashmem
 Physical Memory Allocator ION
 Autosleep + Wake Locks
  $ cd /sys/power/
  $ cat wakelock
  $ dumpsys
  ToDo! DebugFs
 Alarm
  ToDo! Expand on alarm driver
 CPU Frequency Governor Interactive
  ToDo! Understand about Frequency Scaling Framework
  ToDo! Look at cpufrequtils
 Paranoid Network Security
  $ ls ~/aosp/framework/base/data/etc/platform.xml

ToDo! AIDL Android Interface Definition Language

Building Android from the Source

 $ ls aosp/frameworks/base/core

Application cannot communicate to a Service directly, so Binder is here to help
GoTo
 developer.android.com
and search for LocationManager
Look at all the functions provided version by version
The Manager (LocationManager) is responsible to pass information from the Manager to the Service
All Managers seats under
 $ ls /framework/base/core/

Managers are compiled under framework.jar
All Services seats under
 $ ls /framework/base/services/

Services are compiled under services.jar
So in the application you will hve your framework.jar
